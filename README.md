## A Little About Me

My name is Stewart Wilson. I live in Orange County, California. I graduated with a BA in Philosophy from Cal State University Fullerton in 2019 and Iam now purusing an MS in Data Science at Bellevue University. I think that philsophy and data science complement each other nicely, one offering the abstract analytical and critical thinking skills necessary to draw conclusions and make arguments, the other providing the methodological tools to do the research.

In my spare time (which is not a lot given that I'm pursuing a master's while working full-time) I enjoy reading philosophy, learning languages, and playing video games.
